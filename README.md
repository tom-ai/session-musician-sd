## Running the project locally

1. Clone the repo
2. Run `npm install`
3. Create an `.env.local` file, add the environment variables
4. Run `npm run dev` and it should load the project

## Hosting & Deployment

Hosted on Vercel, they make deployment mega easy. Any pushes to `main` branch trigger a new production build.

Pushes to any other branch will tigger a preview build with a private URL.

## Domain & Email

The domain is registered with Cloudflare.

Cloudflare also offer free Email Routing. I've set it up so that any email to `contact@sophiadignam.co.uk` gets routed to a private Gmail account. This has the benefit of hiding her personal email online whilst looking professional, and removes the need to open a separate mailbox.

To respond with `contact@sophiadignam.co.uk`, I've used Postmark to sign the domain and added the appropriate DNS records to Cloudflare.

## CMS

For the CMS we're using DatoCMS. It has a friendly interface for adding content, is free and doesn't require a second project to maintain.

Data fetching is done on the server via HTTP. I've been roughly following this guide by DatoCMS: https://www.datocms.com/docs/next-js

## CSS, UI and Color

Using Tailwind CSS and the NextUI library (https://github.com/nextui-org/nextui)

Could probably revert to vanilla UI components in the future, but the input elements are really nice (although a bit broken in some places!)

Colors and such are being injected to a custom NextUI theme via the NextUI config. This theme extends the out-of-the-box dark theme.

We're using the Harmony Color Palette by Evil Martians (https://github.com/evilmartians/harmony) as a replacement for NextUI/Tailwind.

Follow the steps here to change colors: https://github.com/tom-ai/session-musician-sd/issues/22
