## CSS, UI and Color

Styling is done with Tailwind CSS and the NextUI library (https://github.com/nextui-org/nextui)

Could probably revert to vanilla UI components in the future, but the input elements are really nice (although a bit broken in some places!) 

Colors and such are being injected to a custom NextUI theme via the NextUI config. This theme extends the out-of-the-box dark theme.

We're using the Harmony Color Palette by Evil Martians (https://github.com/evilmartians/harmony) as a replacement for NextUI/Tailwind.
